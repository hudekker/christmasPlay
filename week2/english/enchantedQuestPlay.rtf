\

\fs36 Introduction: 
\fs24 \
\
In a chill little town nestled between rolling hills and super old trees, two lifelong buds, Alex and Morgan, feel the pull towards this mysterious forest on the edge of town. Locals call it Eldertree Grove, and rumor has it, it's holding onto some secrets from way back.\
\
So, Alex, the go-getter and all-around curious cat, talks Morgan, the deep thinker, into checking out Eldertree Grove. It's a crispy fall day, leaves on the ground giving off that earthy smell, and the sun's throwing warm vibes through the rustling leaves, making everything feel kinda magical.\
\
These pals, tight from years of doing life together and totally getting each other, decide to dive into this adventure. Not just for the kicks, but also because they heard there's some hidden treasure in there that's supposed to sprinkle wonder and joy on whoever finds it.\
\
As the curtain goes up, these two step into Eldertree Grove, totally buzzing with excitement. The journey kicks off, showing off the power of friendship, the cool stuff nature throws our way, and the mind-blowing discoveries waiting in the heart of this mystical forest.\
