《奇蹟之夜的頌歌》

我打伯利恆走過
觀察牧人與羊群
卻未料今夜神奇
將歷史分為前後

遇見三博士者遠道而來
肩負著特殊的使命
尋找一位微小的嬰兒
拯救人類於枷鎖

我遇博士者尋找的，
在明星之下馬槽內。
與謙卑農場的動靜，
天下羔羊何以在此？

當嬰兒小小的降臨，
如同美麗的錯誤，
祂不是被世界誕生的，
世界是透過祂創造的

“Miracle of the Holy Night" 

I walked through Bethlehem,
Observing shepherds and their flock.
Little did I know, this night,
Would split history in twain.

Encountering three wise men from afar,
Bearing a unique mission,
Searching for a tiny infant,
To liberate mankind from its shackles.

I met the wise men’s sought-after,
Under bright shining star, inside a manger.
Amongst farm animals, it is Him.
How is it the Lamb in such humble place?

When the infant arrived, so tiny,
Like a beautiful mistake,
Not born by the world,
But the world created through Him.
